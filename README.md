# Python_Calculator


This project was done in 24 hours and was my first programming project as a Freshman. It was a part of a 24 hour Hackathon hosted by my school.


This project is just a fully functional calculator that I made with the help of a module called tkinter. I used basic programming skills learned in my class to make the calculator full work.

I learned a lot from this project at this was my very first official project.
